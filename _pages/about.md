I am a third-year PhD student in Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh. My supervisor is Tim Adamo. My main research interests are in flat space holography and on-shell scattering methods. On the flat holography side, I use twistor theory methods to study the asymptotic chiral algebra structures emerging in celestial holography and their relation to scattering amplitudes and integrable sectors of Yang-Mills or gravity both in four and higher dimensional spacetimes. I am also interested in the relationship between Carrollian correlators and the flat space limit of AdS correlators, with an ongoing interest in extending the known results and dictionary to non-trivial backgrounds and accounting for thermal effects. In a different direction, I study perturbative aspects of black-hole scattering in five dimensions through the classical limit of higher-spin amplitudes.
